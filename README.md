EaseCI is a project that enables rapid deployment of applications in popular technologies. 
A simple interface allows creating complex Delivery Pipeline even for newbies. 
The project is an open source created by people who want to save the suffering associated with deployment.

## Main principles

If you want to develop the EaseCI project, you must follow several community rules:
- the code must be logically divided into packages
- we follow the rules of clean SOLID code etc.
- every interface and base class must be provided with valuable comments
- the project must have high code coverage, unit tests are required for each commit

## Technologies used

In Ease CI you can write in any JVM language. No matter which one.
The only condition is that the application works properly.
- Java 11
- Kotlin 1.3
- Groovy 2.5
- Spring 5 (Spring Boot 2.2.2)
- Junit 5
- Pivotal Reactor
