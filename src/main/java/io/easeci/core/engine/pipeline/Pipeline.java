/**
 * Pipeline class is heart of EaseCI workflow.
 * This is a POJO class that holds information about Pipeline's runtime.
 * It always must be created from Easefile (that could be obtained from various sources).
 * It is simply - bridge between text file (Easefile) and engine that executes our declarative code.
