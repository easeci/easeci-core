 * Main point of resolving issues with plugins integrity

 * What problem could PluginSystemIntegrityFixer solve?
 * For instance: EaseCI core just downloaded plugin and
 * process unexpectedly was killed. Then, new configuration
 * was not saved correctly to file. After restart EaseCI core
 * we will receive PluginSystemCriticalException.class at startup,
 * so application could not run.
 * In that case PluginSystemIntegrityFixer should be run after
 * exception thrown and fix this discordant in configuration files.
